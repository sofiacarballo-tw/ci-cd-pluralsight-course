# CI/CD Pipeline with .NET and GitHub Actions (Inspired by Pluralsight Course)

This repository contains the code and configurations used to demonstrate a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for a .NET application, inspired by the Pluralsight course: [DevOps: Continuous Integration and Delivery - Setting Up a CI/CD Pipeline](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/devops-continuous-integration-delivery-settingup-cicd-pipeline/table-of-contents).

This project aims to illustrate the fundamental principles and practical implementation of an automated software delivery process using GitHub, GitHub Actions, and the .NET ecosystem.

## Course Alignment

This repository's structure and workflow are designed to mirror the key concepts and steps covered in the Pluralsight course, including:

* **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automating the build, test, and validation of code changes.
* **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Extending CI to automatically prepare code changes for release to production.
* **Pipeline Automation:** Utilizing GitHub Actions to define and execute the CI/CD pipeline.
